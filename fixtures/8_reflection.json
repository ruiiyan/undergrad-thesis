  "situation": "In week 9 during our breakout room, our tutor, Maya introduced a new member, Asma to our team. It was quite exciting to get to know a new person from our tutor group but that meant that we had to make adjustments to our plan and design of the RGM project.",
  "task_action": "As a group, we introduced ourselves and tried to make a comfortable space for Asma to contribute in. We were urged to start brainstorming ideas for new events to satisfy the criteria where each students should have two action events. We had to go back to our timeline with all the drawings and diagrams of our RGM project and find out where we could add new events without changing any of the previous ones. With maximum participation from every group member, we made a successful judgment upon the final decision and were able to create two more events that fit with our timeline of events to allocate to Asma. To ensure these events were reliable, we used critical thinking before executing our new events. We made diagrams and labels for each event including, issues we might face and solutions that will help. For example, one new event involved a cup getting tipped over and a pin would fall out and pop a balloon. We analysed an issue where the pin might not pop the balloon, which was solved by sticking two pins together to make it more sharp and blowing up the balloon more so that the surface is thinner and easy to pop. A few days after this workshop, we tested the event and it was successful only 14 out of 20 times. We continued to make further adjustments in order to achieve a 100% reliability. We also applied the same steps with all of our events to maximise our reliability tests.",
  "result": "We were able to achieve 100% reliability for most of our events through critical thinking, where we identify issues, analyse and find possible solutions to resolve it. This process allowed us to make judgements whether an event is worth executing and if it will actually work, which in this case worked and is now a part of our final RGM project.",
