  "situation": "I decided to design, manufacture and program a macropad for my personal computer.",
  "task_action": "During the design and programming process I needed to learn two brand new applications both of which took quiet a while to get a hand of and required perseverance. In order to complete the project, it required investing hundreds of hours of my spare time in order to complete and deliver the project by the due date, exhibiting my urgency and willingness to deliver. Some resourcefulness was needed during early prototyping in the manufacturing process using home made methods to create makeshift rigid PCBs and further flexibility with receiving final designs from the manufacturer and ordering components to be soldered from suppliers.",
  "result": "Due to my perseverance, urgency and will to deliver, and resourcefulness/flexibility. I completed the project in time to work out unexpected issues and deliver it in near perfect condition to what I had envisioned.",
